 Lineage II Medusa is an interlude (x75 mid rate) server with PVP balance as main focus that also includes party and daily instance farming.
 Our goal is to provide new and entertaining content to the community.
 To do so, our developer team has implemented next generation areas and mobs well adapted into an ancient mythology setting. 
 <br><br>
 We have implemented a unique balance system by minimizing the gap between players while giving the community a chance to use almost all classes and races.
 As such; weak classes like tanks,healers and dwarf classes have been boosted with extra skills. Extra skills are NOT usable in the Olympiad.
 <br><br>
 Duplicate Cardinal class in party reduces total healing effect by 25%. To avoid this penalty, it is recommended to have a combination of two different classes
 from the following options: Cardinal, Eva Saint, and Shillien Saint.  
<br><br>
 We have applied a special PvP system with special rewards and ranking system. Furthermore , you can eliminate enemies inside the temple of Parthenon (Clan PvP Area) for personal and clan
 rewards, in an outstanding experience.
 <br><br>
  There is a fair donation system focusing on visuals and some in-game consumables or wearable items. Premium status rewards the player
  with the premium badge, premium name, free entrance on dungeons and increased chance on augmentation process.</font>
