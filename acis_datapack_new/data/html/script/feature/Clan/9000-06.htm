<html><body><font color="LEVEL">[Clan Leader delegation request]</font><br>
One of the Clan members can be selected and be delegated the role of Clan Leader.<br>
If you request delegation of Clan Leader, it is usually completed every Tuesday. However, sometimes the delegation process can be completed sooner then that. Please consider your decision carefully before making the request.<br>
Once the delegation process is completed it cannot be canceled. However, it is possible to cancel it if process has been not completed.<br>
I'll say this once more. Since the delegation of a Clan Lord is the process in which all the rights of a Clan Leader are transferred to another Clan member, you need to consider your decision very carefully before submitting your request.<br>
