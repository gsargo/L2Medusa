		Lineage II Medusa is an Interlude (x75 mid rate) server with PVP balance as main focus that also includes party and daily instance farming. 
		Our goal is to provide new and entertaining content to the community. 
		To do so, our developer team has implemented next generation areas and mobs well adapted into an ancient mythology setting. Botting or flaming
		are strictly prohibited. Players should use the game for pleasure and entertainment purposes , by respecting the community of the server and the staff.
